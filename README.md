# Exploring-R-Math189

R Markdown reports from a class that introduced a number of statistical methods in R. 

* Project 1: An analysis of video game impacts on the attitudes of college students (Kaggle Dataset). Important concepts: Bootstrap, basic visualization methods like boxplots, histograms, curve fitting, ggplot2, pi charts, chi square proportion testing, qq-plots. \

* Project 2: Pattern Analysis of the CMV DNA molecule. Searching for replication sites in the DNA to find locations of complimentary palindromes within it. Important concepts: Random scatter simulations, distribution comparison, cdfs, densities, stripcharts, stripcharts for visualization, Poisson and Uniform random sampling, pairwise distance analysis. 

* Project 3: Calibration of Snow Gauge for Snow Density Measurement. Creating accurate exponential predictive model for gamma ray measurements from snow density. Important concepts: Linear regression, transformation, robsutness, simulation, confidence intervals and prediction intervals, cross validation, polynomial curve fitting.
